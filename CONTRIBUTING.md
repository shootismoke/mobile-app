# Contributing to Sh\*\*t! I Smoke

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use Github Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPL-3.0 Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPL-3.0 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/amaurymartiny/shoot-i-smoke/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

The code style adheres to [semistandard](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard). We use an opiniated `eslint`, which is configured to behave like `prettier` + `semistandard`.

Run `yarn lint` to make sure that your code passes linting. You can optionally add the `--fix` flag to let `eslint` automatically fix some errors.

## License
